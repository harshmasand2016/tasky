## 🔐 Auth Flow

- Passwords are **hashed with bcrypt**
- On login, a **JWT access token** and **refresh token** are issued
- Refresh tokens are:
    - Stored in MongoDB (hashed)
    - Auto-expire via TTL indexing
    - Single-use (deleted on refresh)

---

## 🧪 Validation Rules

### Email
- Required
- Must match format: `example@domain.com`

### Password
- Required
- 6–10 characters
- At least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 special character
- No spaces allowed
